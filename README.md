This is a home automation system built using a Raspberry Pi 4. The system is designed to collect sensor data and automate various tasks based on that data.

Phase I - In this phase, sensor data is collected using an Arduino that is connected via serial. The sensors used in this phase include temperature, noise level, magnetic field, light, and humidity.

Phase II - In the second phase, moisture levels of five plants are read using capacitive moisture sensors. When the moisture levels reach a predetermined level, a water pump is activated to water the plants. The long-term goal of this phase is to implement machine learning algorithms to improve plant health.

Phase III - In the third phase, automatic blinds are implemented based on light levels and time of day. The system uses the light reading from the light sensor to adjust the position of the blinds. A motor controlled by the Arduino is used to rotate the slats position. The long-term goal of this phase is to implement machine learning algorithms to optimize the position of the blinds.

Phase IV - In the fourth phase, the system is equipped with voice interaction through ChatGPT. The system is capable of audio response to voice commands.

Phase V - In the fifth and final phase, the system is enhanced with image processing for plants and weather to take predictive actions. The goal is to use machine learning to predict the needs of the plants based on the images captured by the system and weather data.
